\section{App Development (Dave Stanton)}
\subsection{Users Goals Metrics}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Who is the user? What are their goals?
  \item Come up with a "persona" to represent the people who will
    be using your app.
  \item Have general "metrics of success"
  \item One-size-fits-all software doesn't really appeal to anyone in particular
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{example}
\begin{description}
  \item[Developer]
  \item[IT Manager]
  \item[CIO]
\end{description}

\subsubsection{5 person useability studies}
Often just testing with 5 people can give great insight into what works and
what doesn't in terms of the user interface. Track the errors they make
(thinking they were clicking on something when they really weren't) and tweak
the software. Need to make sure you have the appropriate testers for the
software.

\subsection{Strategy}
\begin{description}
  \item [Exit Strategy] What will you do if it takes off?
    Is it a full time project or just a project done out of curiosity?
  \item [Defense] What makes your app different from what already exists?
  \item [Funding source] dictates how you can build features
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Funding}
\begin{description}
  \item [bootstrap] Your own money, you dicate how to build the software
  \item [grant] grants tend not to care as much how it is build, just whether
    it achieves the end goal
\end{description}
With grants, need to know when to stop. Don't undervalue your time.

\subsection{Flow}
\begin{description}
  \item[Flow Diagram] Create before writing code, can save time in the long run.
  \item[Wire Frame] Representation of user interfaces. Each wireframe should
    have an associated persona and goal. Appearance not important, very high
    level
  \item[Composite] Mock-up, generally looks better than wireframe
  \item[Paper Prototype] Walk someone through using a paper version of the app
  \item[Define MVP] Minimally Viable Product: what is the minimum required for
    app to "work"
  \item[Prioritizing Features] what are the most important features? What are
    blocking features? In what order should features be completed so everyone
    can work in parallel?
  \item[Tickets] use goal tracker (e.g. Trello) and issue tracker (e.g. github
    issues.)
  \item[Sprints] define a time period for work, set backlog during planning
    meeting, typically have once-a-day $\approx$ 15min "standup" meeting
  \item[Quality Assurance] mutliple environments (work, staging/integration,
    production). Test in an environment exactly like the "real-world". Run test
    suites.
  \item[Release]
  \item[Retrospective]
\end{description}

\subsection{Common Trouble}
\begin{description}
  \item[Scope creep] Keep adding new features, which delays release and bloats
    product
  \item[Nebulous Hierarchy] can't have a "flat" team. Assign specialties or
    lead roles to members.
  \item[Too many stakeholders] Who "says yes" for a particular kind of decision?
  \item[Automating too soon] don't over-engineer too soon. Just make it happen
    as quick as possible
\end{description}

\subsection{Stack}
Make sure you are using the appropriate technology for the project

\section{Crowd Sourcing (Sean Goldberg)}
\subsection{Big Data}
\begin{description}
  \item[Volume] Existing data waiting to process
  \item[Velocity] Data in motion (Streaming)
  \item[Variety] structured, unstructured, text, multimedia
  \item[Veracity] data in doubt (inconsistency, incompleteness, ambiguity,
    latency)
\end{description}
Want to organize this data. Example: Wikipedia info box.

\subsection{Machine Learning}
training set $\rightarrow$ learning algorithm $\rightarrow$ heuristic

\subsubsection{Examples of use:}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Self-driving car
  \item Machine translation (like Babel Fish from Hitchhiker's Guide)
  \item Amazon reccommendations
  \item Apple's Siri (natural language question $\rightarrow$ database query)
  \item license plate processing
  \item Watson (jeopardy playing robot)
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Current Machine Learning Limitations}
\begin{itemize}
  \item Natural Language Processing still limited
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Crowd Sourcing}
Human processing power can make up for areas that machines lack. Try to combine
human and machine computation to complete a goal.\\
Bringing in a single human is not efficient. Need an effective way to source
the collective knowledge of many humans.\\
\subsubsection{Amazon Mechanical Turk}
Provides a marketplace for sourcing human intelligence.
\begin{itemize}
  \item Make an open call for jobs
  \item People sign up for jobs
  \item People complete task with human intelligence
  \item People get payed
  \item Allows parallelization of tasks
\end{itemize}
Example use: Collecting Training data for an intelligent system. If you are
training a system to identify emotions by looking at a picture, you need people
to look at the pictures and classify them so the machine can learn from them.

\subsubsection{TurKit}
A programming toolkit that integrates human intelligence as subroutines in your
code.

\subsubsection{Soylent}
A MS Word plugin using people to perform word processing tasks that are
difficult fr a computer (shortening, proofreading, macro)

\subsubsection{CrowdDb}
Use human intelligence to correct and optimize a database in ways that are
difficult for a machine.

\subsubsection{DbPedia}
Make wikipedia queryable like a database by using human intelligence.

\subsection{CASTLE (Crowd Assisted System for Text Labeling and Extraction)}
Converting unstructured text into a structured form (database) that can be
queried.

Combine probablilistic database with crowd knowledge.\\
Run a machine learning algorithm over text to tag tokens. The algorithm
generates a set of possible tags, each with a given correctness probablility.
Identify uncertain tags and source them to humans by automatically posting HITs.
