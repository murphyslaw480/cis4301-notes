Notes for CIS4301 UF Spring 2014
================================ 
This repository holds notes I am taking during CIS4301 at UF during the spring
2014 semester.
This is a sort of experiment to see if I can take notes on the fly in LaTeX. I'm
learning LaTeX as I go, so some of it may be pretty ugly. For the time being,
I'll try to push new notes at least once a week, but I can't guarantee I'll keep
it up the entire semester.

Some things are probably incomplete and I probably missed some things, so feel
free to put in a pull request if you notice something missing or wrong.
